# Sales_Dashboard
# This is my First Power BI Project
#The objective here is to get hands-on with the various KPIs in Power BI
Here I have used
--->  Donut Charts to get insights about the sales on various segments like payment method, Region, etc
--->  Card visualization for getting the overall orders, sales, and profit.
--->  Clustered bar charts to get the sales info by product category and ship mode.
--->  Stacked area chart to compare the orders and profits earned for the years 2019 and 2020.
--->  Map visualization to get the sales in a particular geographical location as it is easy to understand by its visual appearance where the sales are more.
--->  Slicer for filtering out the sales based on the regions.
--->  Forecasting to know the sales for the next coming 15days.
The objective here is to use my data analysis techniques to draw some insights from the data which can lead to the success of the business in the near future.

Insights 
* Almost 42% of the payments are made by Cash on delivery(COD).
* In the month of September even though the order quantity is more the profits earned in that month are less when compared to the profits earned in the month of October where the order quantity is low compared to September,
  here it may be the reason that most of the orders placed were not so in demand products where the cost of that product will be usually high leading to fewer profits, whereas for the month of October may be any Sale might be organized leading to more profits.
